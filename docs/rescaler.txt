- i'm hoping it'll fit into 4hp wide.
- this one is to have standard black panel.
- there are no knobs [for now].
- somehow will have to draw on some gfx that
imply the dif scalings relative to eachother, just dunno how.
- likewise the routings - a few lines connecting it all up just to
show signal flow.
- i suspecc there may still be significant room on panel so
maybe need to invent a lil graphic that's more n just abstract logo
but is simple and reprasentative and catchy too.
